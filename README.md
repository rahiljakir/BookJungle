to update value in table, start updating values in any cell by clicking on it. and press Update Button.

to delete any row,  select the row you want to delete. and press delete. 

there is not any hard constraint on data entry. due to this crashing is highly possible so if any error occurs persistently. delete "Books.dat" file and reopen Application or just press refresh if possible(this will try to delete "books.dat" file)

Reset is just for cleaning all the input  text field all at once.
